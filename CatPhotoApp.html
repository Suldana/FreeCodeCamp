The questions and answers of the freeCodeCamp Step 1Passed HTML elements have opening tags like
<h1> and closing tags like </h1>. The text for an element goes between its opening and closing tags. Find the h1 element and change its text to: CatPhotoApp
<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>

Step 2Passed The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements. Only use one h1 element per page and place
lower importance headings below higher importance headings. Below the h1 element, add an h2 element with this text: Cat Photos

<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
<h2>Cat Photos</h2>

Step 3Passed The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites. Create a p element below your h2 element and give it the following text: Click here to view more cat photos.
<h2>Cat Photos</h2>
<p>Click here to view more cat photos.</p>

Step 4Passed Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with
<!--, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with -->. For example, the comment
<!-- TODO: Remove h1 -->contains the text TODO: Remove h1. Add a comment above the p element with this text: TODO: Add link to cat photos

<!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
<p>Click here to view more cat photos.</p>

Step 5Passed HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility. Identify the main section of this page by adding a
<main> opening tag before the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag after the p element. Solved

<main>
    <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
    <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
    <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
    <p>Click here to view more cat photos.</p>
</main>

Step 6Passed In the previous step, you put the h1, h2, comment, and p elements inside the main element. This is called nesting. Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called
indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read. The h1 element, h2 element and the comment are indented two spaces more than the main element in the code below. Use the space bar on your keyboard to add two more spaces in front of the p element
so that it is indented properly as well.
<main>
    <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
    <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
    <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
    <p>Click here to view more cat photos.</p>
</main>
Step 7Passed You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag. Add an img element below the p element. At this
point, no image will show up in the browser.
<p>Click here to view more cat photos.</p>
<img src="" alt=""> Step 8Passed HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located). An example of an
img element using an src attribute: <img src="https://www.example.com/the-image.jpg">. Inside the existing img element, add an src attribute with this URL: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt=""> Step 9Passed All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the
image fails to load. For example, <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat"> has an alt attribute with the text A cat. Inside the img element, add an alt attribute with this text: A cute orange cat lying on its back
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" Alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back"> Step 10Passed You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element. For example,
<a href='https://freecodecamp.org'></a> would link to freecodecamp.org. Add an anchor element after the paragraph that links to https://freecatphotoapp.com. At this point, the link wonâ€™t show up in the preview.
<p>Click here to view more cat photos.</p>
<a href='https://freecatphotoapp.com'></a>
Step 11Passed A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element. For example, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org</a> is a link with the text click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org.
Add the anchor text link to cat pictures to the anchor element. This will become the link's text.
<a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">link to cat pictures</a> Step 14 Add a target attribute with the value _blank to the anchor (a) element's opening tag, so that the link opens in a new tab.

<p>Click here to view more <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a>.</p>
Step 15 Turn the image into a link by surrounding it with necessary element tags. Use https://freecatphotoapp.com as the anchor's href attribute value. Step 16 Before adding any new content, you should make use of a section element to separate the cat
photos content from the future content. Take your h2, comment, p, and anchor (a) elements and nest them in a section element.
<main>
    <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
        <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
        <p>Click here to view more <a target="_blank" href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a>.</p>
        <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com"><img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>
    </section>
</main>
Step 17 It is time to add a new section. Add a second section element below the existing section element.
<section>
    <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
    <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
    <p>Click here to view more <a target="_blank" href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a>.</p>
    <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com"><img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>
</section>
<section>
</section>
Step 18 Within the second section element, add a new h2 element with the text Cat Lists.
<section>
    <h2>Cat Lists</h2>

</section>
Step 19 When you add a lower rank heading element to the page, it's implied that you're starting a new subsection. After the last h2 element of the second section element, add an h3 element with this text: Things cats love:
<section>
    <h2>Cat Lists</h2>
    <h3>Things cats love:</h3>
</section>
Step 20 After the h3 element with the Things cats love: text, add an unordered list (ul) element. Note that nothing will be displayed at this point.
<h2>Cat Lists</h2>
<h3>Things cats love:</h3>
<ul></ul>
Step 21 Use list item (li) elements to create items in a list. Here is an example of list items in an unordered list:

<ul>
    <li>milk</li>
    <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
Within the ul element nest three list items to display three things cats love: cat nip laser pointers lasagna
<ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
</ul>
Step 22 After the unordered list, add a new image with an src attribute value set to: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg And its alt attribute value to: A slice of lasagna on a plate.
<ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate."> The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption. Nest the image you just added
within a figure element.
<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
</figure>
Step 24 A figure caption (figcaption) element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained within the figure element. For example,
<figcaption>A cute cat</figcaption> adds the caption A cute cat. After the image nested in the figure element, add a figcaption element with text set to: Cats love lasagna.
<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
    <figcaption>Cats love lasagna.</figcaption>
</figure>
Step 25 Emphasize the word love in the figcaption element by wrapping it in an emphasis em element.
<figcaption>Cats <em>love</em> lasagna.</figcaption>
Step 26 After the figure element, add another h3 element with the text: Top 3 things cats hate:
<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
    <figcaption>Cats <em>love</em> lasagna.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Top 3 things cats hate:</h3>
Step 27 The code for an ordered list (ol) is similar to an unordered list, but list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed. After the second section element's last h3 element, add an ordered list with these three list items: flea treatment
thunder other cats
<h3>Top 3 things cats hate:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>flea treatment</li>
    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
</ol>
Step 28 After the ordered list, add another figure element.
<ol>
    <li>flea treatment</li>
    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
</ol>
<figure>
</figure>
Step 29 Inside the figure element you just added, nest an img element with a src attribute set to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg.
<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" alt="">
</figure>
Step 30 To improve accessibility of the image you added, add an alt attribute with the text: Five cats looking around a field.
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" Alt="Five cats looking around a field."> Step 31 After the last img element, add a figcaption element with the text Cats hate other cats.
<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" alt="Five cats looking around a field.">
    <figcaption>Cats hate other cats.</figcaption>
</figure>
Step 32 The strong element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent. In the figcaption you just added, indicate that hate is of strong importance by wrapping it in a strong element.
<figcaption>Cats <strong>hate</strong> other cats.</figcaption>
Step 33 It is time to add a new section. Add a third section element below the second section element.
<section>
    <h2>Cat Lists</h2>
    <h3>Things cats love:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cat nip</li>
        <li>laser pointers</li>
        <li>lasagna</li>
    </ul>
    <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
        <figcaption>Cats <em>love</em> lasagna.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Top 3 things cats hate:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>flea treatment</li>
        <li>thunder</li>
        <li>other cats</li>
    </ol>
    <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" alt="Five cats looking around a field.">
        <figcaption>Cats <strong>hate</strong> other cats.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</section>
<section>
</section>
Step 34 Inside the third section element, add an h2 element with the text: Cat Form
<section>
    <h2>Cat Form</h2>
</section>
Step 35 Now you will add a web form to collect information from users. After the Cat Form heading, add a form element.
<h2>Cat Form</h2>
<form></form>
Step 36 The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example,
<form action="/submit-url"></form> tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url. Add an action attribute with the value https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo to the form element.
<form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
</form>
Step 37 The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, input elements are self-closing and do not need closing tags. Nest an input element in the form element.
<form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
    <input>
</form>

step 38 There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute. You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer. Create a text field to get text input from a user by adding
the type attribute with the value text to the input element. Solved

<input type="text"> Step 39 In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted. For example, you could
use the following syntax for an email address text field: <input type="text" name="email">. Add the name attribute with the value catphotourl to your text field.
