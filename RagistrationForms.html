Step 1 Welcome to the Registration Form project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading. solution::

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body>

</body>

</html>

Step 2 Below the DOCTYPE, add an html element with a lang attribute set to en, so that you have a place to start putting some code. solution::

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

</html>

Step 3 Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element. solution::

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head></head>

<body></body>

</html>

Step 4 Add a title and a meta element to the head. Give your project a title of Registration Form, and give a charset attribute with a value of UTF-8 to your meta element. solution::

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Registration Form</title>
</head>

Step 5 Nest a self-closing link element within the head element. Give it a rel attribute with value of stylesheet and an href attribute with a value of styles.css. solution:;

<head>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Registration Form</title>
</head>

Step 6 Within the body, provide a heading context for the content, by adding an h1 with the text Registration Form. solution::

<body>
    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
</body>

Step 7 Below the heading, use the following text within a paragraph element to encourage users to register: Please fill out this form with the required information solution::

<body>
    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>
</body>

Step 8 The vh unit stands for viewport height, and is relative to 1% of the height of the viewport. It is time to spruce the project up with some CSS. Begin by giving the body a width of 100%, and a height of 100vh. solution:: body { width: 100%; height:
100vh; } Step 9 Now, get rid of the horizontal scroll-bar, by setting the body default margin added by some browsers to 0. solution:: body { width: 100%; height: 100vh; margin: 0px; } Step 10 That is better. Now, make the background easy on the eyes,
by changing the body background-color to #1b1b32. Then, to see the text, change the color to #f5f6f7. solution:: body { width: 100%; height: 100vh; margin: 0; background-color: #1b1b32; color: #f5f6f7; } Step 11Passed As suggested by the title, you are
creating a form. So, after the p element, insert a form with an action attribute targeting https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org. solution::

<body>
    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>
    <form action='https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org'></form>
</body>
